# MD5FileAntivirusDetectionHaritTalwar

In this program, I developed a C# program that represented the MD5 depiction of any given file. My program would then detect whether the file contained any viruses. As represented through my code and the screenshots, the simple design of the program is represented as well as the selection of the file. Although I have been able to represent the MD5 of the file, I keep running into the same error (screenshot provided) when asking my program to scan the file for any possible viruses.
